### Introduction:

During the piscine, you were a project to work with hardware of the device, namely accelerometer. Hopefully you haven't forgotten how it is done, since in this project you have to use apply something similar, but slightly more complex.

Develop an app intended to work with GPS, accelerometer, magnetometer and real-time update. Updating image at least 10 times in a second is considered to be real-time update.
You will be using hardware sensors' information to determine your location, and position of the device, i.e. is it looking down/up to the west/east.   
By having the data from sensors, you will send the data to the public [API](https://google.com), retireve information about celestial objects, and display them on the black canvas.
By tapping on the object, you must display short descripton of the object.
Make sure to manage states via any of the following patterns:
- BLoC
- Provider

Objects to be diplaeyd:
- All planets of our solar system, the moon
- the sun
- 3 constellations of preference


### Objective:

- Working with hardware sensors
- Collecting all the celestial object in OOP style
- Rendering objects in real-time.
- Work with APIs
- Provider - [documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)

Possible examples of the app:
